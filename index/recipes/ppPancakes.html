        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup vanilla protein powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup oat flour (note: Oat flour is made by blending oats for 30 seconds in a blender)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tsps baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4-3/4 cup vanilla unsweetened almond milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk protein powder, oat flour, egg, baking powder, and 1/4 cup almond milk in a medium-size bowl. Add almond milk two tablespoons at a time until you have a smooth, slightly running pancake batter.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or pancake griddle to medium and add cooking spray to the pan. Make pancakes by adding 1/4 cup of the batter per pancake to the skillet, leaving room between them so that the pancakes don't touch each other when they spread out. Cook for 1-3 minutes before flipping the pancake over. Pancakes are ready to flip as soon as you can slide the spatula underneath. They will not bubble.</li>
            <li>Serve with berries, syrup, nut butter, or whatever you like!</li>
        </ol>
